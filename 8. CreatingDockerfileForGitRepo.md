# Git repo synced Dockerfile

The follwing steps guides developers to build an image which will fetch the code from the github to sync
These steps are for my  own  repository  and expects a  node server  application. However, if concept is 
understood then there should be no problem replicating the same for other apps too.

1. Define the run time environment or the base image.
   ```
   FROM node:20-alpine
   ```
2. Define the workdir
   ```
   WORKDIR /app
   ```
3. Install git using docker pakage manager
   ```
   RUN apk add --no-cache git
   ```
