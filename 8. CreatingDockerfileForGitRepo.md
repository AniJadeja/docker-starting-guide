# Git repo synced Dockerfile

The follwing steps guides developers to build an image which will fetch the code from the github to sync
These steps are for my  own  repository  and expects a  node server  application. However, if concept is 
understood then there should be no problem replicating the same for other apps too.

1. Define the run time environment or the base image.
   
   ```
   FROM node:20-alpine
   ```
   
2. Define the workdir
   
   ```
   WORKDIR /app
   ```
   
3. Install git using docker pakage manager
   
   ```
   RUN apk add --no-cache git
   ```
   
4. Clone the git repo
   
   ```
   RUN git clone https://github.com/AniJadeja/luxe-wheels-backend.git 
   ```
   
5. change the workdir to the downloaded repo
   
   ```
   WORKDIR /mplus/luxe-wheels-backend
   ```

6. Make sure that it has `package.json` which will be required to install the modules
   
   ```
   RUN test -f package.json || { echo "Error: package.json not found in repository"; exit 1; }
   ```

7. Install the modules
   
   ```
   RUN npm install
   ```

8. Expose the port, in my case it is 10000
   
   ```
   EXPOSE 10000
   ```

9. Copy the required files which are not in the git repo
    
   ```
   COPY .env .
   COPY serviceAccountKey.json .
   ```
   
10. Start the server when container is run
    
   ```
   CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
   ```

So the whole file will look like this
   ````
   #Choose the base image
   FROM node:20-alpine
   
   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /mplus
   
   # Install Git
   RUN apk add --no-cache git
   
   # Clone the Git repository into the container
   RUN git clone https://github.com/AniJadeja/luxe-wheels-backend.git
   
   #Change the work dir to the repo
   WORKDIR /mplus/luxe-wheels-backend
   
   # Verify that the repository contains a package.json file
   RUN test -f package.json || { echo "Error: package.json not found in repository"; exit 1; }
   
   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install
   
   # Expose port 10000
   EXPOSE 10000
   
   # Copy the required files
   COPY .env .
   COPY serviceAccountKey.json .
   
   # Start the application
   CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
