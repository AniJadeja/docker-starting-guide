# Bind Project Source Code to the Docker Container


Binding project means that the dir present in the host machine will be mapped to the docker container and any subsequent changes to files inside the docker dir will result in host machine's files getting changed as well.
This is ideal when the code is used for development where the code needs to be synchronized with host machine as well.

1. Create a base image or get a base image container.

2. navigate to the directory.

3. run the following command :
     ```
     docker run -v <absolute_path_on_host>:<absolute_path_in_container>
     ```
     note : there should be no space between two paths and paths must be absolute.
            make sure you are outside the directory which you want to use it further.
            make sure the names are correct. Incorrect names would not result in error,
            it will result in no files present in the container.

     for example, if you want to use the source code located inside of the `./source` dir, then
     you need to be outside of the dir.

     ie, on the host machine, the folder structure looks like this :
     ```
     Desktop
         |
         my_code
             |
             source
                 |
                 foo.py
     ```

     the content of the `source` directory is needs to be binded with container's `./my_source` dir.
     ```
     docker run -v $PWD/source:/my_source first_image
     ```

     to check if the files are getting copied or not :

     ```
     docker run -it -v $PWD/source:/my_source first_image
     ```

     inside the container terminal:
     ```
     cd my_source
     ls
     ```

     if the files of the `source` dir is present in the `my_source` then there were no names error in command,
     otherwise look for the mis spelled command
