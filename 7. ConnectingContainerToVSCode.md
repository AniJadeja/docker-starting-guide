# Connecting Container To VS Code

1. Create A `Dockerfile` at the root of the project which you want to containerize.
2. For example, we are going to use the previous example.
    ```
    FROM node:20-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm cache clean --force
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    EXPOSE 3000 
    CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
    ```
3. Make sure that image could be built and container is able to be run.
   3.1 To build an image : https://github.com/AniJadeja/docker-starting-guide/blob/main/4.%20DockerImageBuild.md
   3.2 To run a container : https://github.com/AniJadeja/docker-starting-guide/blob/main/5.%20RUNTheDockerContainer.md
4. Install `devcontainer` or `remotedevelopment` extension from vs code extensions.
