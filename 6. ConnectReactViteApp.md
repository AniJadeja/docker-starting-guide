# Connect React Vite App

1. Make sure node is installed in your system. (Node 18 and later is needed)
   
3. create react app with:
   ```
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

4. Choose appropriate options. i.e. name `test_vite`
   
5. open the `test_vite` dir.
   
6. create a `Dockerfile` exactly like this.
   
8. Configure `Dockerfile` :
   ```
   FROM node:20-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json .
   RUN npm cache clean --force
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 3000 
   CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
   ```

7. First line in `Dockerfile` chooses the base image for the container.

8. Second line sets the working dir as an app for the container.

9. third line copies the `package.json` from the image bulding dir to the container root dir. in this case `/app/.`

10. `RUN` command runs the command at the build time.

11. `COPY` command again copies the rest of the files.

12. `EXPOSE` command exposes the container port because by default container is isolated and nothing is exposed.
